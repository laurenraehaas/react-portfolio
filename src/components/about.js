                <p>Hello there! I'm Lauren, and when I'm not immersed in the world of front-end development, you'll find me immersed in a good book or sharing playful moments with my energetic two-year-old daughter. The art of crafting captivating user interfaces and experiences has captivated my curiosity, driving my passion for front-end development.</p>
